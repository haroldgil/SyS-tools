  "body": "### Introduction\r\nThe abundance of R tools freely-available online for data analysis and visualization presents not only opportunities, but also challenges for adoption in that these tools must be integrated so as to allow a structured workflow. Many public health surveillance practitioners do not have the time available to: \r\n* scavenge for tools,\r\n* align their functions so as to create a relevant set of visuals, and\r\n* integrate these visuals into a dashboard that allows a streamlined surveillance workflow. \r\n\r\nAn openly-available, structured framework that allows simple integration of analytic capabilities packaged into readily-implementable modules would simplify the creation of relevant dashboard visuals by disease surveillance practitioners.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nThis webpage showcases several analytic tools for syndromic data analysis. Examples include: \r\n* heatmaps\r\n* change-point detection\r\n* outlier detection\r\n* tables\r\n* maps \r\n\r\nThis site also describes how to mesh features from different packages together into dashboards so that you can easily adopt these tools and integrate them into your disease surveillance workflow.\r\n\r\n### Test\r\nAuthor your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).\r\nAfter your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
