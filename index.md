## Introduction
The abundance of R tools freely-available online for data analysis and visualization presents not only opportunities, but also challenges for adoption in that these tools must be integrated so as to allow a structured workflow. Many public health surveillance practitioners do not have the time available to: 

* scavenge for tools,
* align their functions so as to create a relevant set of visuals, and
* integrate these visuals into a dashboard that allows a streamlined surveillance workflow. 

An openly-available, structured framework that allows simple integration of analytic capabilities packaged into readily-implementable modules would simplify the creation of relevant dashboard visuals by disease surveillance practitioners.

## Features
This webpage showcases several analytic tools for syndromic data analysis. Examples include: 

* historical trend-line
* heatmaps
* change-point detection
* maps 

This site also describes how to mesh features from different packages together into dashboards so that you can easily adopt these tools and integrate them into your disease surveillance workflow.

You can see the code to generate these examples in the [SyS-tools GitHub repository](https://github.com/haroldgil/SyS-tools/). For a step-by-by walkthrough of how to use the code, see the [SyS-tools GitHub wiki](https://github.com/haroldgil/SyS-tools/wiki/). 

## Authors and Contributors
Many of the tools demoed on this page were entirely developed by others. I do not take credit for their work. My main contribution here is to collate, adapt, and present them in one location.
